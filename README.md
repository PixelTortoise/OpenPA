# OpenPA
An open source and customizable personal assistant for your computer

# How to install
This program relies on a few third party python packages you need to install, and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Commands to install required packages

`pip install speechrecognition`

`pip install pyttsx3`

# How to use
There will eventually be a wiki on this if I continue with this project, but as of right now there are two seperate txt's the program will generate, config.txt and open.txt


## config.txt is only used for the name of your program, for example if it was named Jarvis, you would say "Jarvis open google" to open google

Syntax is as followed, do not put more than one space after it, a single space does not matter
```
name=(name)
```
## open.txt holds names of programs, and paths to there executable

Syntax is as followed, use as many lines as you can
```
(programname)=(programpath)
(programname)=(programpath)
(programname)=(programpath)
```
